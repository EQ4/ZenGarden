Build
-----

Here is how to build the java demo from scratch.
	cd src
	make

You can build individual components like so:
	# build the library as a shared object file
	make libzengarden
	# build the Java Native Interface as a shared object file
	make libjnizengarden
	# build the Java hosted example
	make examplegarden

Test
----

This runs the Java hosted example
	./runme.sh
