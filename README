ZenGarden is a standalone library for running Pure Data patches.

It is beta quality software - expect bugs and don't expect everything to be
implemented.

Requirements
------------

libsndfile
	- OSX: port install libsndfile
	- Debian GNU/Linux: apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

java - for the java example - you need at least java5
	- Debian: apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

python - for the python example
	- ctypes (in Python 2.5 or greater)
	- pygame - http://pygame.org/

Run
---

The following commands both optionally take the full path to a Pd patch as
their first argument:

 * `./runme-java.sh`
 * `./runme-python.sh`

Build
-----

Here is how to build the library, JNI, etc. from scratch.
	cd src
	make

You can build individual components like so:
	# build the library as a shared object file
	make libzengarden
	# build the Java Native Interface as a shared object file
	make libjnizengarden
	# build the Java hosted example
	make examplegarden

Advantages
----------

Why use ZenGarden?

* Clean code and API
* Portable and embeddable
	* Embedded devices, synthesizers
	* Mobile phones
	* Inside other languages
	* LADSPA, VST, etc.
* Compiling Pd as a library is non-trivial and requires modifications to Pd vanilla
* Less bloat
	* No GUI
	* No hardware specific audio driver code

Layout
------
