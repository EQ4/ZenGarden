ZenGarden is a standalone library for running Pure Data patches.

It is beta quality software - expect bugs and don't expect everything to be implemented.

https://github.com/mhroth/ZenGarden/

Requirements
------------

libsndfile
	- OSX: port install libsndfile
	- Debian GNU/Linux: apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

java - for the java example - you need at least java5
	- OSX: It's already installed
	- Debian: apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

Run
---

This runs the Java hosted example:
	./runme.sh

Build
-----

Here is how to build the java demo from scratch.
	cd src
	make

You can build individual components like so:
	# build the library as a shared object file
	make libzengarden
	# build the Java Native Interface as a shared object file
	make libjnizengarden
	# build the Java hosted example
	make examplegarden

Advantages
----------

Why use ZenGarden?

* Clean code
* Portable and embeddable
	* Embedded devices, synthesizers
	* Mobile phones
	* Inside other languages
* Compiling Pd as a library is non-trivial and requires modifications to Pd vanilla
* Less bloat
	* No GUI
	* No hardware specific audio driver code

Layout
------

src/
	- Source code

src/me/
	- Java JNI demo source

Xcode/
	- Xcode project

pd-patches/
	- Demo Pd patches

pd-patches/unittest/
	- Pd patches for doing unit testing of ZenGarden
